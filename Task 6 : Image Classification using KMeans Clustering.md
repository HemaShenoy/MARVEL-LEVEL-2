### Task 6: Image Classification Using K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning algorithm often used for grouping data into clusters based on feature similarities. In this task, you will classify a set of images into different categories using the K-Means algorithm, specifically applying it to the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits.

#### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Understand K-Means Clustering**: 
   - K-Means works by identifying `k` centroids for `k` clusters. It assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculates the centroids based on the assignments until convergence.
 

2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), where each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
   - Download the dataset from [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

3. **Preprocessing the Data**:
   - Normalize the images (scale pixel values between 0 and 1).
   - Flatten the images into vectors (from 28x28 to 784-dimensional vectors).

4. **Implement K-Means Clustering**:
   - Choose the number of clusters `k`. For digit classification, `k` will be 10 (one for each digit).
   - Use a library like `scikit-learn` to implement K-Means.
   
5. **Train the Model**:
   - Fit the K-Means model on the flattened image data.
   - Predict the clusters for the training data.

6. **Evaluate the Results**:
   - Visualize the clustered images by displaying a few examples from each cluster.
   - Analyze how well the clustering corresponds to the actual digit classes.

7. **Example Code**:
   Below is a structured outline of how you might implement this in Python:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

   # Load MNIST dataset
   mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
   X = mnist.data / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values

   # Apply K-Means clustering
   k = 10  # Number of clusters (digits 0-9)
   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
   kmeans.fit(X)

   # Get cluster centers and labels
   cluster_centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_.reshape(k, 28, 28)

   # Plotting cluster centers
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(10, 5))
   for ax, center in zip(axes.ravel(), cluster_centers):
       ax.imshow(center, cmap='gray')
       ax.axis('off')
   plt.show()
   ```

8. **Expected Results**:
   - The cluster centers should resemble the average digits for each digit class.
   - You can further analyze how well the K-Means clustering has performed by looking at the silhouette score or other clustering metrics.


### Conclusion
This task allows you to explore how K-Means clustering can be used for image classification, giving insights into both unsupervised learning and practical applications in computer vision. Feel free to experiment with different values of `k` and analyze the clustering results further!
